    "# Graph Cut Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part you will implement foreground-background segmentation using *Markov random fields* (MRF) and graph cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap from the lecture\n",
    "A Markov random field is a graphical model that expresses the structure of (input and output) variables. In our image segmentation case this structure means that we do not simply model the foreground and background pixel colors but also take into account the neighborhood relations of the pixels. This encodes the intuition that neighboring pixels are more likely to belong to the same region than just two random pixels of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The color (or more generally, appearance) models and the neighborhood relations are combined in a so-called *energy function* (or cost function), which is then minimized to obtain an optimal label-assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a structured input (here: image pixel colors) $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{Y_j|j \\in I\\}$ we want to find the output (here: labeling) $\\mathcal{X} = \\{X_j | j \\in I\\}$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\mathcal{X}} = \\arg \\min_{\\mathcal{X}} E(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y}) = \\sum_{j\\in I}{\\psi_u (X_j,Y_j)} + \\sum_{i, j\\in I}{\\psi_p (X_j,X_j,Y_i,Y_j)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The set $I$ contains all possible pixel indices. In our two-label (binary) segmentation case, the label variables must be either 0 (background) or 1 (foreground) $X_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The so-called *unary potential* $\\psi_u (X_j,Y_j)$ is the cost of assigning the label $X_j$ to a pixel with color $Y_j$. In probabilistic terms, the unary potential is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\psi_u (X_j,Y_j)=-\\omega_u \\cdot \\log p(X_j|Y_j),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with an appropriate model $p$ for the foreground and the background and a weighting factor $\\omega_u$. The unaries encourage labeling each pixel with the label (foreground/background) whose color model is a better fit for that particular pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pairwise potential* $\\psi_p$ incorporates the dependencies between pixels. To speed up the computation, the pairwise model is usually restricted to neighboring pixels and is therefore set to zero if the $i$th and $j$th pixels are not direct neighbors in a 4-neighborhood. In our case it written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\psi_p (X_i,X_j,Y_i,Y_j)=\\omega_p\\cdot\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,&\\text{if }   X_i\\neq X_j \\text{ and } i,j \\text{ are neighbors}  \\\\\n",
    "0,&\\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with some weighting factor $\\omega_p$. Such a pairwise potential encourages neighboring pixels to have the same label because it gives some nonzero cost to each pair of neighboring pixels that are assigned different labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, a Graph Cut method is used to find the optimal solution $\\hat{\\mathcal X}$ of the energy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bird's eye overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to get lost in all the details, so here's an roadmap of what we're going to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the Markov Random Field (define unaries and pairwise potentials), in more detail:\n",
    "    1. Manually define some approximate initial background and foreground regions in the image\n",
    "    2. Model the distribution of background and foreground colors based on the colors found in the approximate initial regions\n",
    "    3. For each pixel independently, calculate the posterior probability of being foreground, based on the models from the previous step (create a \"probability map\")\n",
    "    4. Calculate the unary potentials based on the foreground probability map\n",
    "    5. Define the pairwise potentials (using the neighborhood relations)\n",
    "2. Use the graph cut algorithm to minimize the energy function of the Markov Random Field and obtain a labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not have to implement the graph cut algorithm yourself, we use the `gco-wrapper` package instead. There is no `conda`-package available, but we can install it using `python3 -m pip install gco-wrapper`. (This is a Python wrapper over the C++ gco library. The C++ library can be found at https://vision.cs.uwaterloo.ca/code/). Make sure to activate the environment first."

    "## Color Modeling by Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to model color distributions is to use *Gaussian mixture models*. However, to keep this exercise simple, we will only use color histograms (i.e. the relative frequencies of quantized colors) in the respective region of the image defined by the boxes. In other words, we model the color simply as a discretized, categorical random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `calculate_histogram`. It should take as input the image `im` with values in the range $[0, 255]$ and a `mask` the same size as the image. The mask is 1 at the positions of the image where the histogram should be computed, zero elsewhere. The final parameter `n_bins` defines how many bins should be used in the histogram along each dimension. The function should **return a 3-dimensional array** of shape `[n_bins, n_bins, n_bins]`, containing the relative frequency for each `(r, g, b)` color bin within the region of the image defined by the mask, i.e. the fraction of pixels falling within each bin. The histogram should be normalized (sum to 1). All bins are initialized with a small value ($10^{−3}$) to avoid relative frequencies which are zero. (Why would zeros be a problem?)"
